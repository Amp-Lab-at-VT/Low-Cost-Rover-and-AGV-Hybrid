title: Low Cost Rover and AGV Hybrid
description: Learning for the failures of the AGV Project and the shortcomings of the Odroid Control board project, I will use the very successful low cost rover board, with some slight modifications, to control the original AGV chassis. A small scale demonstrator is almost complete. This project just expands upon that idea to use components from the odroid control board project to make a solid robot control board that future AMP Lab members could use.
